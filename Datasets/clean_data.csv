The property is gated, however, gates are left open by people walking in. There are shopping carts on the property from stores that can't be seen nearby. The paint on the doors is chipped and leftover spray paint can be seen around the edges of some of the apartment doors as well. The apartment itself appears old and outdated. The carpet is dingy and the lighting is low. The apartments come with built in bookshelves and washer and dryers located behind 2 double doors off from the dining area. The kitchen has a small bar area but is fairly small with limited counter space. The second bedroom is located next to the front door and the master bedroom is in the back of the apartment making this a suitable layout for roommates or parents with older children.
