In my project, I conducted a thorough exploratory analysis to uncover insights into the apartment rental market and its relationship with state-specific economic data. Utilizing datasets from [UC Irvineâ€™s Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/555/apartment+for+rent+classified) and additional state-specific data from [Wise Voter](https://wisevoter.com/state-rankings/average-income-by-state/), I examined the correlation between average incomes and rental prices across states. My analysis aimed to provide actionable recommendations for optimal living spaces based on affordability and economic factors. I explored various aspects, including how apartment features like the number of bedrooms and pet policies influence rental prices, offering valuable insights for renters, policymakers, and real estate stakeholders.

## What did I learn?
In completing my project, I significantly enhanced my data analysis skills using R and Excel. Through R, I mastered data manipulation and visualization techniques using libraries like dplyr and ggplot2, which were crucial for handling large datasets efficiently. In Excel, I improved my proficiency in advanced functions, formulas, and the strategic use of pivot tables and charts to summarize data effectively. The integration of R and Excel in my workflow proved invaluable, allowing me to leverage R's analytical strengths and Excel's capabilities in data presentation and quick analyses. This experience has greatly increased my confidence in extracting actionable insights from real-world data.
